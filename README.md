So, important note.

In order for sprites or tiles to be affected by lights, you need to change the material of the sprite or tile renderer (If they have materials). The name of the material is Sprite-Lit-Default. When searching for it, you might not find it since it is hiden, you need to press the button of the crossed eye and maybe search for the name to see it
