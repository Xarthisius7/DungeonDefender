A few things of the people unfamiliar with Lights and Shadows. If you want to remove the darkness in the map when generating, simply select the object called "Ambient Light", then go to intensity on the inspector, and change the value from 0 to a higher one like 1 to get normal or better visibility. The player also has a light conencted to it called "Azur Core". 
It is a spot light. It has an inner light, where light is at the maximum value, and an outer light, where the value starts to lower. There is a value below called shadow strength, which if set to max (to 1), light will be unable to penetrate shadow borders and will cause casting of very black shadows.
